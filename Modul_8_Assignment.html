    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is Bootstrap?</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework designed to come up with mobile-friendly, responsive front-end web development. It consists of enormous versatile and reusable pieces of code written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. As a framework, fundamentals are already placed for responsive web development, and developers simply need to position the code in a premeditated grid system. Therefore, while coming up with a new website or application, Bootstrap is a boon because it waives off the burden of coding from scratch. You can efficiently blend its ready-made coding blocks, CSS-Less functionality, and cross-browser compatibility to save tedious hours of coding.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Due to this whole concept, web designing in a limited period is a reality. Besides, it is equipped with free tools, which helps build some common website interface components, thus adding to the adaptability of the framework.</p>

    <h3>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? </h3>
    
    <p>&#8921</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s responsible for setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined within the container class (.container). In other words, we can say that containers are established the width for the layout to give the content. Elements and content are added within the container.</p>
    
    <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Containers are used for many purposes such as –</b></p>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>It requires use with the default grid system.</li>
            <li>To establish width for the layout to give web content.</li>
            <li>To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.</li>
            <li>To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How they work</b></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
    
    <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</b></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The table below illustrates how each container’s max-width compares to the original .container and .container-fluid across each breakpoint.</p>
    
    <!-- que3 -->
    
    <h3>3. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h3>
    
    <p>&#8921</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bootstrap 5 uses a default font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its line-height is 1.5. In addition, all < p > elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
    
    <!-- que4 -->
    
    <h3>4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System? </h3>
    
    <p>&#8921</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Our grid supports six responsive breakpoints.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Breakpoints are based on min-width media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl). This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Containers center and horizontally pad your content.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use .container for a responsive pixel width, .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewports and devices, or a responsive container (e.g., .container-md) for a combination of fluid and pixel widths.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rows are wrappers for columns.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes to uniformly apply column sizing and gutter classes to change the spacing of your content.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Columns are incredibly flexible.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., col-4 spans four). widths are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Gutters are also responsive and customizable.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Gutter classes are available across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as our margin and padding spacing. Change horizontal gutters with .gx-* classes, vertical gutters with .gy-*, or all gutters with .g-* classes. .g-0 is also available to remove gutters.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid.</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you don’t want to use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our grid’s source Sass to create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom properties to consume these Sass variables for even greater flexibility for you.</p>

    <h3>7. How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h3>

    <p>&#8921</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bootstrap helps web developers to create thumbnails that are used to show linked images in grids with the pre-defined classes which help to reduce codes length. Thumbnails are created to provide a quick preview of images with small images.</p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Thumbnail Image:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  A thumbnail is a small image that represents a larger image. Bootstrap has an easy way to do this with thumbnails. Bootstrap’s .thumbnail class is used to show linked images in grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail within the element < a >.  The class .col-sm-* and .col-md-* (where * represent number ), it is used to create grids of the images.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Step by step guide for the implementation:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 1: Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the < head > tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 2: Add < div > tag in the HTML body with class row. In that < div > create four div sections to create four images.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 3: Add “col-sm-6” and “col-md-3” to four div sections which creates webpage responsive. </p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 4: Add < a > tag with class value thumbnail to define the link of the image in the next line.</p>
        
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Adding captions and buttons to the thumbnails:</b>
        
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 1: We created div with class value as thumbnail and inserted image, after that add div with class .caption to define the description of the images  < p >.</p>
        
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Step 2: Create buttons using < a > tag with class . btn .btn-success</p>

    <h3>8. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h3>
    
    <p>&#8921</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Flexbox:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Flex utility can be used to manage the layout, alignment, grid columns, navigation and other components of the page. It makes easy to design layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Flex Behaviors and Direction:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Use the flexbox display utilities like d-flex and d-inline-flex to display the flexbox container and children elements into flex items. You can set the direction of flex items in horizontal direction and vertical direction by using .flex-row (use .flex-row-reverse to display horizontal direction from the opposite side) and .flex-column (use .flex-column-reverse to display vertical direction from the opposite side)</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Justify Content:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The alignment of flex items (such as start, end, center, between and around) can be changed on the main axis (x-axis to start) of the flexbox containers by using justify-content utility</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Align Items:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  he alignment of flex items (such as start, end, center, baseline and stretch) can be changed on the cross axis (y-axis to start) of the flexbox containers by using align-items utility.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Fill, Grow and Shrink:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The elements can be displayed into an equal widths on horizontal space by using .flex-fill class. The flex item will grow, if there is available space by using .flex-grow-* class and flex item will shrink, if necessary by using .flex-shrink-* class.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Auto Margins and With align-items:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The flex utility provides auto margin feature on the flex items by using the .mr-auto (pushes items to the right) and .ml-auto (pushes items to the left) classes. The flex items can be moved to top or bottom by using mt-auto or mb-auto classes on a container.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Align Content:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  You can align (such as start, end, center, between and around) the flex items on the cross axis on the container by using align-content utility.</p>

    <h3>9. How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?</h3>
    
    <p>&#8921</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Before or after performing an action, we frequently encounter specific notifications on some websites. These alert messages are highlighted text that should be taken into account when executing a task. Using preset classes in Bootstrap, these alert messages can be displayed on the website.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Approach:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The .alert class followed by contextual classes are used to display the alert message on website. The alert classes are: .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger, .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light and .alert-dark. We can use .alert-warning to create warning notification alerts in bootstrap.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Below is the procedure to implement a simple warning alert in Bootstrap.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> Step 1:</b> Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the < head > tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.</p>
    
    <p>link rel=”stylesheet” href=”https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css”> </p>
    <p>< script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js”> </ script ></p>
    <p>< script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js”> < / script ></p>
    <p>< script src=”https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js”> < / script > </p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> Step 2:</b> Add the .alert and the warning alert contextual classes (e.g., .alert-warning).</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp < div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        A simple warning alert—check it out!
      < / div ></p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is a bootstrap card:</b>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you're familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails.</p>
    
    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Example:</b>
    
    <p>< div class="card" style="width: 18rem;"></p>
    <p>< img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="Card image cap"></p>
    <p>< div class="card-body"></p>
    <p>< h5 class="card-title">Card title < / h5></p>
    <p>< p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <p>< a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere< /a></p>
    <p>< /div></p>
    <p>< /div> </p>
</body>
