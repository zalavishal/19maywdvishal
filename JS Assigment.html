    <h1>MODULE: 4 (JavaScript Basic & DOM)</h1>
    <!-- que1 -->
    <h3>1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part
        of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
        It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the
        excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name
        LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other
        web browsers.</p>
    <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
        <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>
        <li>Open and cross-platform</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
    <p>&#8921NaN stands for Not a Number. It’s a special floating point value that is used to indicate that a result is
        undefined or unrepresentable. I personally see it as the result returned in embedded systems when a sensor is
        disconnected.</p>
    <p>NaN is not less than, greater than, equal to or not equal to any numeric value. It’s also not equal to itself.
        That means that you can’t test whether a variable contains NaN simply by testing whether it is equal to NaN. It
        can’t ever be. Thus, we have the isnan macro to allow us to write the code to test for it.</p>
    <!-- que3 -->
    <h3>3. What is negative Infinity?</h3>
    <p>&#8921On the number-line, the right of zero are positive numbers starting from 1 and left of zero are negative
        numbers starting from -1. If somebody ask me how far can you go right on the number line, I would say infinity.
        And if somebody ask me how far can you go left on the number-line, I would say negative infinity.</p>
    <p>Negative infinity is the smallest number.</p>
    <!-- que4 -->
    <h3>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich at <b> Netscape Communications Corporation</b>, for
        the <b> Netscape</b> Navigator Web browser.</p>
    <!-- que5 -->
    <h3>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
    <p>&#8921 <b>Undefined</b> is a variable that has been declared but no value exists and is a type of itself
        ‘undefined’.</p>
    <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Undeclared</b> variables is a variable that has been declared without ‘var’ keyword.
        demoVar = ‘hello world’.</p>

    <h3>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h3>
    <p>&#8921
        < html> <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< head> <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< title>Adding New Elements< / title> <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< script type=" text / javascript "> <br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfunction addNode() { var newP = document.createElement("p");
                            <br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvar textNode = document.createTextNode(" This is a new text
                            node"); <br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnewP.appendChild(textNode);
                            document.getElementById("firstP").appendChild &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(newP); } <br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< / script> <br>
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< / head> <br>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< body>
                                        < p id=" firstP ">firstP < p>
                                                < / body> <br>
                                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp< / html>
    </p>
    <!-- que7 -->
    <h3>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h3>
    <p>&#8921 <b> ViewState</b>: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level. Changes made on a single page is
        not visible on other pages. Information that is gathered in view state is stored for the clients only and cannot
        be transferred to any other place. View state is synonymous with serializable data only.</p>
    <p>ViewState has a tendency for the persistence of page-instance-specific data. When view state is used, the values
        posted of a particular page persist in the browse area that the client is using and post back only when the
        entire operation is done. The data of the previous page is no longer available when another page is loaded.
        Also, Data is not secure in this case because it is exposed to clients. Encryption can be used for data
        security.</p>
    <p> <b> SessionState</b>: It is maintained at session-level and data can be accessed across all pages in the web
        application. The information is stored within the server and can be accessed by any person that has access to
        the server where the information is stored.</p>
    <p>SessionState has the tendency for the persistence of user-specific data and is maintained on the server-side.
        This data remains available until the time that the session is completed or the browser is closed by the user.
        The session state is only valid for type objects.</p>
    <!-- que8 -->
    <h3>8. What is === operator?</h3>
    <p>&#8921The strict equality operator <b> (===)</b> checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
        result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types
        to be different.</p>
    <!-- que9 -->
    <h3>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed </h3>
    <p>&#8921To add CSS styles with javascript you have to select a element first and store it in a variable and use
        that variable with the style attribute to change CSS styles</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1.var elem = document.getElementById('demo'); <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2.elem.style.color = 'red'; </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And to change class you have to use classList object</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1.var elem = document.getElementById('demo'); <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2.// Remove 'fi' class from it <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3.elem.classList.remove('fi'); <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4.// add 'mi' class to it <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 5.elem.classList.add('mi') <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is how you can change style and class of an element from javascript.</p>

    <h3>10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921 <b> 1.file</b>=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> 2.str</b>= fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write
        the contents to the file.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</p>
    <!-- que11 -->
    <h3>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921 Following are looping structures in Javascript:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For</li>
        <li>While</li>
        <li>do-while loops</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- que12 -->
    <h3>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or value
        to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of
        parseInt() function.</p>
    <p>parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. </p>
    <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspparseInt(Value, radix)</p>
    <p>It accepts string as a value and converts it to specified radix system (any desired numerical value passed by a
        user) and returns an integer (corresponding to the passed in numerical radix value).</p>
    <!-- que13 -->
    <h3>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h3>
    <p>&#8921<b>Delete operator </b> <br>
        The JavaScript delete operator removes a property from an object; if no more references to the same property are
        held, it is eventually released automatically.</p>
    <p>Try it</p>
    <p>const Employee = { <br>
        firstname: 'John', <br>
        lastname: 'Doe' <br>
        };</p>
    <p>console.log(Employee.firstname); <br>
        // expected output: "John" <br></p>
    <p>delete Employee.firstname;</p>
    <p>console.log(Employee.firstname); <br>
        // expected output: undefined</p>
    <p>output: <br>
        > "John" <br>
        > undefined</p>

    <h3>14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alert box</li>
        <li>Confirm box</li>
        <li>Prompt box</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- que15 -->
    <h3>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h3>
    <p>&#8921Usually, when the user clicks a link on a page a new page loads, but this is not always the desired course
        of action. For example, when the user clicks a link on a page, you might want to update the value of a field in
        a form or the value of a variable. To prevent a page from reloading when a link is clicked, the void(0) function
        is used.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
        < a href=" " onclick=" alert ( ' You have clicked the button ' ) > Click here ! < / a > </p>
    <p>Click on the above link. Even though the code within it specifies to display a message in an alert box (and this action does take place), the page will reload automatically.</p>
    <p>We can fix this with void(0):    </p>
    <p> < a  href = " javascript : void ( 0 ) ; " onclick = " alert ( ' You have clicked the button ' )> Click here ! <
                / a>
    </p>

    <h3>16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>&#8921In this article, we will see how can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <P><b>Approach:</b> We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
        Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document.
        We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</P>
    <p>Syntax:</p>
    <p>
        < script> <br>
            window .location = < Path / URL> <br>
                < /script>
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
        < script> <br>
            window .location = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" <br>
            < /script>
    </p>
    <p>So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location Object inside Javascript we can change the
        URL of our window and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our Javascript without any href tag. We will
        build a small working sample to learn it practically.

    <h3>17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>&#8921 <b> The use of innerHTML very slow:</b> The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly
        built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
    </p>
    <p>Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements
        created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it
        to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
        </p>
        <p>Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage usinginnerHTML,
            all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed andrecreated.</p>
            <p>Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
                Example:</p>
                <p> < p id="geek" >Geeks < /p> <br>
                title = document.getElementById('#geek')</p>
                <p>// The whole "geek" tag is reparsed <br>
                    title.innerHTML += '< p> forGeeks < /p>'</p>
                    <p><b> Old content replaced issue:</b> The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + ‘html’ is used instead of object.innerHTML += ‘html’. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus’ and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track.</p>
                    <p><b> Can break the document:</b> There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.</p>
                    <p><b> Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS):</b> The fact that innerHTML can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.		
                    </p>
