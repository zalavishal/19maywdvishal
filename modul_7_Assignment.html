    <h3>1. What is JQuery?</h3>

    <p>&#8921</p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp JQuery:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp JQuery is a fast, small, cross-platform and feature-rich JavaScript library.
        It is designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It makes things like HTML document traversal and
        manipulation, animation, event handling, and AJAX very simple with an easy-to-use API that works on a lot of
        different type of browsers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The main purpose of jQuery is to provide an easy way to use JavaScript on
        your website to make it more interactive and attractive. It is also used to add animation.</p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is JQuery:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp JQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. It is
        cross-platform and supports different types of browsers. It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it
        takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into
        methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed. It is also very useful to simplify a lot
        of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JQuery is a small, fast and lightweight JavaScript library.</li>
        <li>JQuery is platform-independent.</li>
        <li>JQuery means "write less do more".</li>
        <li>JQuery simplifies AJAX call and DOM manipulation.</li>

    <h3>2. How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in JQuery, JQuery Animation?</h3>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. How to Apply CSS Using JQuery:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In this article, we will explore how we can apply CSS styles to HTML
        elements. It is recommended that you have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery before
        beginning this article.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is possible to change the CSS property of an element by using a simple
        JavaScript API, but we try to complete this challenge using jQuery css() method.</p>

    <b>Syntax:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $().css(propertyname, value);</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $().css(properties);</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are many types of CSS methods, which means that each method has the
        same name but takes different parameters. We will discuss only two methods, one of which is used to change a
        single CSS property, while the other is used to change multiple CSS properties simultaneously. With the second
        method, you can pass a JSON string object as a parameter that you want to apply to the HTML element.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp JSON string objects contain CSS properties along with their values, and the
        first method only takes 2 parameters, namely the property name and the value.</p>

    <b>Example:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp By clicking the button, it adds multiple CSS properties to the selected
        element, but by double-clicking the button, it adds only one CSS property. The motive of this example is to show
        the use of two types of CSS methods which are discussed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp
        < body style=" text - align : center ; <br>     
      border : 2px solid green ; <br>
      min-height : 240px ; "> <br>
            < h1 style=" color :green ; "> <br>

                        < / p> <br>
                            < br> <br>
                                < button id=" change "> <br>
                                    clickme <br>
                                    < / button> <br>

                                        let css _ property = <br>
                                        { <br>
                                        " color " : " green " , <br>
                                        " font - size " : " 20px " <br>
                                        } <br>
                                        $ ( ' # change ' ) . on ( ' click ' , function ( ) { <br>
                                        // For multiple css property <br>
                                        $ ( ' # context ' ) . css ( css _ property ) ; <br>
                                        } ) ; <br>
                                        $ ( ' # change ' ) . on ( ' dblclick ' , function ( ) { <br>
                                        // For single css property <br>
                                        $ ( ' # context ' ) . css ( ' display ' , ' none ' ) ; <br>
                                        } ) <br>
    </p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. How to Add Class and Remove Class in JQuery</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The addClass() or removeClass() methods are used to add the CSS classes when
        there is a need to add to our webpage when there is some event listener or to create some kind of effect.
    <p>

        <b>Syntax:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $().css(propertyname, value);</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $().css(properties);</p>

    <ul>
        <b>Adding a class:</b>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $('selector').addClass(class_name);
        </p>
        <b>Removing a class:</b>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp $('selector').removeClass(class_name);
        </p>
    </ul>

    <b>Example:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The following example adds a class that makes the background colour black
        when clicked on ADD CLASS button and also removes that added class when clicked on the REMOVE CLASS button.</p>

    <p>&nbsp
        < style> <br>
            h1 {color : #006600 ;} <br>

            button {color : white ; <br>
            background-color : #006600 ; <br>
            width : auto ; <br>
            height : 30px ;} <br>

            body {text-align : center ; } <br>

            div {margin : 10px ; <br>
            height : 150px ; <br>
            width : 150px ; <br>
            position : relative ; <br>
            text-align : center ; <br>
            display : flex ; <br>
            left : 215px ;} <br>

            .bg-black {background-color : black ; } <br>
            < / style> <br>
                < /head> <br>

                    < body> <br>

                                < button id=" btnadd "> ADD CLASS < / button> <br>
                                        < button id=" btnremove "> REMOVE CLASS < / button> <br>

                                                < script> <br>

                                                    $ ( ' # btnadd ' ) .click ( function ( ) { <br>
                                                    $ ( ' img ' ) .addClass ( ' bg-black ' ) ; <br>
                                                    } ) ; <br>
                                                    $ ( ' # btnremove ' ) .click(function ( ) { <br>
                                                    $ ( ' img ' ).removeClass ( ' bg-black ' ) ; <br>

    </p>

    <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. JQuery Animation?</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The animate() is an inbuilt method in jQuery which is used to change the
        state of the element with CSS style. This method can also be used to change the CSS property to create the
        animated effect for the selected element.</p>

    <b>Syntax:</b>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (selector).animate({styles}, para1, para2, para3 ) ; </p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Here “selector” is the selected element. </p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> Parameter:</b> It accepts four parameters which are specified below</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> Styles:</b> It helps to set new css property.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b> para1:</b> It is optional parameter and used to set the speed of the
        parameter and its default value is 400 millisecond..</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>para2:</b> It is optional and this specifies the speed of the element at
        different position.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>para3:</b> It is optional function that is used to be perform after
        animation is complete.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Return Value:</b> It returns the change that made by using the above
        method.
    </p>

        code to show the working of animate() method:</p>

    <b>Example:</b>

    <p>
        < script> <br>

            $ ( document ).ready( function ( ) { <br>
            $( " # b1 " ).click( function ( ) { <br>

            width: " 300px " <br>
            } ) ; <br>
            $ ( " # box " ).animate ( { <br>
            height : "300px" <br>
            } ) ; <br>
            } ) ; <br>
            } ) ; <br>
            < / script> <br>
                < style> <br>
                    div {width : 100px ; <br>
                    height : 100px ; <br>
                    background-color : green ; } <br>

                    # b1 { margin-top : 10px ; } <br>
                    < / style> <br>
                        < / head> <br>
